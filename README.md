# TMDb-Analysis

This project is a part of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, I use the Python libraries Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the dataset and then communicate my findings about it. 

In this project, I perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by The Movie Database(TMDb). This data set contains information about more than 10,000 movies, including popularity, ratings, revenue, and budget between 1950 and 2015. I will explore the types of movie genres that are most popular from year to year, and examine the properties that are associated with movies with high revenues.

Please refer to `Investigate_TMBd_Dataset.ipynb` for full code.
